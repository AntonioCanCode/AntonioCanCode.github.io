                    <p>For the final project of the General Assembly course, we were tasked with showcasing all the
                        skills we learned. All the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript was coded by me. This project is responsive
                        and I really focused on making it interactive. Almost every party of the interface responds to
                        the users actions.</p>

                        creating the custom victory and loss responses. </p>

                        took this course after the GA course and it was interesting to see that I still had a lot to

                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <h4>I love a good puzzle!</h4>
                <p>At first, I thought web development wasn't for me. Then I took charge of a Squarespace website for
                    work, and
                    that all changed. Once I had a really good handle on Squarespace I started feeling caged in. I knew
                    there were ways I could add more and more functionality, but Squarespace wasn't offering it. That's
                    when I started to learn how to code here and there. First, I fixed a nav bar, next a few buttons,
                    and then
                    I was hooked. Every time I set a goal, I had to figure out the code behind it. I found myself
                    researching online for hours trying to make sense of the bits and pieces of code that i found. Then
                    one day, I realized coding was for me because I loved figuring out the solutions to the various
                    problems being in charge of a website presented. After taking a course at General Assembly,
                    I discovered there was so much more I could do. Deciding to double-down, I took SkillCrush's Break
                    into Tech
                    Course, where I found new puzzles to solve and some amazing solutions to help me along the way.Now,
                    I'm continuing to learn and constantly thinking about coding projects.</p>

                <p>I'm Antonio and I love to code. Coding feels like a puzzle that I just have to solve. I often find
                    myself losing track of time while I'm coding. I am a problem solver, an innovator, and a great
                    teammate.

                    In a team dynamic, I am the person who is always trying to find the best way to accomplish the
                    task. I enjoy coming up with new ideas or expanding upon the ideas of my team mates. I don't mind
                    having
                    my ideas picked apart and creating something better together. I believe in uplifting my teammates
                    because I don't just want to win, I want all of us to win. A win is better when it's shared.

                    I work best in environments where I am challenged and where the pursuit of knowledge is encouraged.
