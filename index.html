                    <h5>HTML CSS JavaScript Project</h5>
                    <p>For the final project of the General Assembly course, we were tasked with showcasing all the
                        skills we learned. All the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript was coded by me. This project is responsive
                        and I really focused on making it interactive. Almost every party of the interface responds to
                        the users actions. I created a JS object and I used this object to
                        populate the price field with the value of the price key</p>

                        game functional. It involved working with another persons HTML and CSS code. I really enjoyed
                        creating the custom victory and loss responses. </p>

                        with replicating a website from a PDF design comp. I really enjoyed this project because it
                        helped to cement how to use Photoshop with web development. </p>

                        helped me to understand how to use flexbox to make some elements of the design easier. </p>

                        taught me how to float elements and gave me a better idea of how to structure my html and css code. I
                        took this course after the GA course and it was interesting to see that I still had a lot to
                        learn about HTML and CSS.</p>

                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I'm Antonio, and I love to code. Coding feels like a puzzle that I just have to solve. Often, I find
                    myself losing track of time while I'm coding. I am a problem solver, an innovator, and a great
                    teammate. In a team dynamic, you'll find me trying to find the best way to accomplish the task. I
                    enjoy coming up with new ideas or expanding on teammates' ideasâ€”I don't mind having my ideas picked
                    apart to create something better together. I believe in uplifting my teammates because I don't just
                    want to win, I want all of us to win. And, a win is better when it's shared. I work best in
                    environments where I am challenged and where the pursuit of knowledge is encouraged.
